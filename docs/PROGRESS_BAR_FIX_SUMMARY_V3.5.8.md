# Progress Bar Fix Summary - V3.5.8
## Date: August 5, 2025

### Issues Addressed:
1. **Progress bar too wide** - Taking up entire screen width
2. **Progress bar blinking** - Disappearing and reappearing around 50 seconds
3. **Premature dismissal** - Bar disappearing before extraction completes
4. **Processing notification persistence** - "Processing Data" spinner not clearing

### Solutions Implemented:

#### 1. Reduced Progress Bar Width
- Changed from `left-4 right-4` to `left-1/4 right-1/4`
- Now occupies center 50% of screen width
- More compact and less intrusive

#### 2. Fixed Blinking Behavior
- Removed condition `realTimeProgress < 100` that was hiding bar prematurely
- Added progress bar start time tracking to ensure minimum display time
- Ensured bar stays visible throughout entire extraction process

#### 3. Improved Dismissal Logic
- Extended auto-dismiss timeout from 5 to 10 seconds
- Added database check before dismissing to ensure extraction is truly complete
- Progress bar now waits for database widget to update before hiding

#### 4. Enhanced State Management
- Added `progressBarStartTime` state to track when extraction begins
- Improved WebSocket message handling to maintain consistent visibility
- Better coordination between progress bar and database widget updates

### Files Modified:
- `client/src/pages/upload-page-controlling-file-05_24_25.tsx`
- Backup created: `backups/v3.5.8-fixed-loading-and-progress-08_05_25/`

### Testing Notes:
- Progress bar should remain visible for entire extraction duration (2+ minutes)
- No blinking or flickering during processing
- Automatic dismissal only after database widget shows extracted symptoms
- Manual close button (X) remains available for user control

### Known Behavior:
- Extraction typically takes 2-3 minutes for large datasets
- Progress updates may pause at certain percentages (normal behavior)
- Database widget updates all at once when extraction completes
- "Processing Data" notification should clear when extraction completes
