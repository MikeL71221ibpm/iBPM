# Session Summary: May 18, 2025

## Overview
Today's session focused on resolving UI functionality issues in the HRSN Analytics application, specifically related to the Count/Percentage toggle in visualization components. We fixed several bugs that were causing NaN values to display during animation transitions when toggling between display modes.

## Completed Tasks

1. Fixed NavigationButton component
   - Added optional `size` prop to match shadcn Button component options
   - Made the icon prop optional to increase flexibility
   - Added proper type safety and handling to prevent errors

2. Enhanced HrsnPieChartV31 component
   - Improved tooltip implementation to handle animation transitions properly
   - Added additional safeguards against NaN values in formatLabel function
   - Ensured all numeric values are properly validated and formatted

3. Started debugging additional TypeScript errors
   - Identified issues with component property types
   - Began working on comprehensive fixes for LSP errors

## Current Status
- The v3.1 components have been created with improved type definitions and built-in display mode toggling
- The NavigationButton component now properly supports size variants
- Work is ongoing to fix remaining LSP errors and ensure consistent behavior across all charts

## Next Steps
1. Complete fixes for remaining LSP errors in standardized components
2. Test the updated components thoroughly to ensure they handle all edge cases
3. Continue standardizing the remaining visualization components
4. Update documentation to reflect the latest changes

## Technical Notes
- The NaN issue was occurring during animation transitions when toggling between count/percentage views
- Added safety checks and proper type handling to prevent rendering issues
- Used more robust data processing to ensure reliable visualization rendering
