# Remix Deployment Steps - Execute Now

## Step 1: Access Remix Feature
1. Look for "Remix Template" or "Fork" button in your Replit interface
2. This is typically located in the top-right area of your workspace
3. Click "Remix Template" to create a clean copy

## Step 2: Configure Remix Settings
1. In the "Remix App" dialog that appears:
   - Keep the same project name or add "-deployment" suffix
   - Ensure "Public" visibility is selected for deployment
   - Click "Remix App" to proceed

## Step 3: Verify Essential Files Copied
After remix completes, verify these critical files are present:
```
✅ client/src/ (all React components)
✅ server/ (Express backend)
✅ shared/schema.ts (database types)
✅ package.json (dependencies)
✅ .replit (configuration)
```

## Step 4: Set Environment Variables
In the new workspace, add these secrets:
```
DATABASE_URL=your_neon_database_url
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_key
NODE_ENV=production
```

## Step 5: Test the Clean Version
1. Click "Run" in the new workspace
2. Verify the application starts without errors
3. Test login with existing credentials
4. Confirm database connection (should show 2,456 patients, 73,925 symptoms)

## Step 6: Deploy Clean Version
1. Go to "Deployments" tab in the new workspace
2. Click "Deploy" button
3. Monitor deployment progress
4. Verify deployment succeeds without size limit errors

## Expected Results:
- ✅ Same exact functionality as current workspace
- ✅ Clean Git history (no 1.7GB bloat)
- ✅ Successful deployment under 8GB limit
- ✅ All 73,925 symptoms and patient data accessible
- ✅ Authentication, charts, and features work identically

## If Issues Occur:
- Return to this workspace (remains untouched)
- Use rollback feature to restore any checkpoint
- All data remains safe in Neon database
