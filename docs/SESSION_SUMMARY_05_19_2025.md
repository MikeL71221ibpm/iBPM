# Session Summary: May 19, 2025

## Overview
Today we successfully integrated the refined V3.2 symptom matcher algorithm with significant improvements for symptom extraction and organization. The new system preserves duplicate matches to better indicate symptom intensity while organizing results by multiple dimensions.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Symptom Matcher Algorithm V3.2 Integration
- ✓ Created context-aware matcher that recognizes symptoms following phrases like "patient reports"
- ✓ Implemented organization by symptom_segment, diagnosis, diagnostic category, and diagnosis code
- ✓ Enhanced the negation detection system with reporting phrase overrides
- ✓ Added ability to preserve duplicate matches for intensity measurement
- ✓ Integrated with main application via dedicated API endpoints

### 2. Automated Comparison Tool
- ✓ Built a comprehensive system to compare V3.0 and V3.2 symptom matchers
- ✓ Scheduled regular algorithm comparisons (weekly by default)
- ✓ Implemented detailed metrics calculation (precision, recall, improvement %)
- ✓ Created API endpoints for manual comparison triggering
- ✓ Added reporting functionality to monitor algorithm improvements

### 3. API Endpoints
- ✓ `/api/v3.2/symptoms/extract` - Extract symptoms using refined matcher
- ✓ `/api/v3.2/symptoms/compare` - Compare results between both algorithms
- ✓ `/api/v3.2/symptoms/version` - Get version information
- ✓ `/api/v3.2/algorithm/compare` - Trigger full dataset comparison
- ✓ `/api/v3.2/algorithm/reports/latest` - Get most recent comparison report
- ✓ `/api/v3.2/algorithm/reports` - List all comparison reports

## Technical Details

### Symptom Matcher V3.2 Features
1. **Context-Aware Matching**
   - Recognizes symptoms in clinical narratives with better accuracy
   - Detects symptoms following reporting phrases ("patient reports", "presents with")
   - Respects section boundaries (chief complaint, assessment, plan, etc.)

2. **Comprehensive Organization**
   - By Symptom Segment: Groups by specific symptom text
   - By Diagnosis: Organizes under parent diagnoses
   - By Diagnostic Category: Groups by broader medical categories
   - By Diagnosis Code: Organizes by ICD-10 or similar code prefixes

3. **Enhanced Extraction**
   - Preserves all matches including duplicates for intensity measurement
   - Improves negation detection with contextual awareness
   - Tracks section context for each symptom match

### Algorithm Comparison Tool
The system now performs automatic comparisons between the original (V3.0) and refined (V3.2) symptom matching algorithms:

1. **Metrics Tracked**
   - Total symptoms extracted by each algorithm
   - Unique symptoms found by each algorithm
   - Shared symptoms (found by both)
   - Precision (% of V3.2 matches that original algorithm found)
   - Recall (% of original matches that V3.2 algorithm found)
   - Overall improvement percentage

2. **Scheduling**
   - Weekly automated comparison (Sundays at 2 AM)
   - On-demand manual comparison via API
   - Full reports saved for historical tracking

## Example Usage

### Extracting Symptoms with V3.2
```javascript
// POST to /api/v3.2/symptoms/extract
{
  "patientIds": ["patient1", "patient2"],
  "options": {
    "preserveDuplicates": true,
    "useWordBoundaries": true,
    "considerNegation": true
  }
}
```

### Comparing Algorithms
```javascript
// POST to /api/v3.2/symptoms/compare
{
  "patientIds": ["patient1"]
}

// OR with sample text
{
  "note": "Patient reports anxiety and insomnia."
}
```

### Triggering Full Comparison
```javascript
// POST to /api/v3.2/algorithm/compare
{
  "sampleSize": 100  // Optional: Use subset of notes
}
```

## Next Steps
1. Run the first full comparison to establish baseline metrics
2. Fine-tune algorithm parameters based on comparison results
3. Consider adding more organization dimensions if needed
4. Explore visualization options for comparison reports

## Rollback Capability
The implementation maintains complete separation between V3.0 and V3.2 versions, allowing easy rollback if needed. The original symptom matcher continues to operate alongside the new version.
