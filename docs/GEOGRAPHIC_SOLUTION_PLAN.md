# ZIP Code Mapping Solution Plan

## Current Problem
- We have 3 ZIP boundaries in our GeoJSON file
- Database has hundreds of ZIP codes (10001, 10002, 10003, 10009, etc.)
- **This is why the map is empty** - no boundary matches for most ZIP codes

## MapInfo vs. Current Setup
**MapInfo Process:**
1. Load patient data with ZIP codes ✓
2. Load complete ZIP boundary layer ❌ (we only have 3 boundaries) 
3. Join and visualize ❌ (fails due to missing boundaries)

**What We Need:**
Complete US ZIP code boundary file with ~42,000 ZIP code polygons

## Solution Options (in order of recommendation)

### Option 1: Download Complete GeoJSON File (RECOMMENDED)
**Best Sources:**
- GitHub: https://github.com/OpenDataDE/State-zip-code-GeoJSON
- Alternative: https://github.com/ndrezn/zip-code-geojson  
- Size: ~50-100MB
- Format: Ready-to-use GeoJSON

### Option 2: External Mapping Service
**Services:**
- Mapbox GL JS
- Google Maps JavaScript API
- Both have complete ZIP boundary support

### Option 3: State-Level Mapping (CURRENT WORKING SOLUTION)
**Advantages:**
- Works immediately with existing data
- Complete state boundary coverage
- Still provides geographic insights

## Technical Implementation
Once we have complete boundaries, the existing SimpleZipChoropleth component will work:
1. Patient ZIP codes → Count by ZIP
2. Join with boundary polygons  
3. Color by patient density
4. Display on map

## Recommendation
Use Option 1 (download complete file) - this most closely matches your MapInfo workflow.
