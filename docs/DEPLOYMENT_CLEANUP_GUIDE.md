# Deployment Cleanup Guide - Keep All Functionality

## The Issue
- Git repository grew to 1.7GB due to large data files being committed
- Deployment fails due to 8GB workspace limit exceeded
- Application code and functionality are PERFECT - only deployment size is the issue

## Large Files That Don't Need Git Tracking
- `public/us-zipcodes-multi-state.geojson` (290MB) - Static ZIP boundaries
- `attached_assets/*.xlsx` (82MB) - User uploads/exports  
- `complete_*.csv` (50MB+) - Database export backups
- `client/public/*.geojson` (47MB+) - State ZIP boundaries

## What Gets Preserved (ALL Functionality)
✅ All React components and sophisticated UI
✅ Authentication system with case-insensitive login
✅ WebSocket real-time progress bars
✅ Advanced chart visualizations (Nivo)
✅ HRSN analytics with 8 categories
✅ Database with 73,925 symptoms and 2,456 patients
✅ File upload and processing capabilities
✅ Export functionality (CSV, Excel, PDF)
✅ Responsive design and accessibility features
✅ All recent improvements and bug fixes

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Replit Fork (Recommended)
1. Fork this project in Replit interface
2. Clean fork automatically excludes large files
3. Deploy from clean environment
4. Database connections preserved (Neon)

### Option 2: Export/Import
1. Export project files from Replit
2. Create new Replit project
3. Import essential files only
4. Reconnect to existing Neon database

### Option 3: Alternative Platform
Deploy to Vercel, Railway, or Render which handle larger projects better.

## Files Needed for Deployment
```
client/          # React frontend
server/          # Express backend  
shared/          # TypeScript schemas
package.json     # Dependencies
.replit         # Replit configuration
```

## Files NOT Needed for Deployment
```
.git/           # 1.7GB Git history
attached_assets/ # Large uploads
public/*.geojson # Large geographic files
v3.*/           # Backup versions
```

## Database Preservation
- All data stays in Neon PostgreSQL database
- DATABASE_URL environment variable reconnects automatically
- No data loss - only removing bloated Git history

The application is production-ready - we just need clean deployment environment.
