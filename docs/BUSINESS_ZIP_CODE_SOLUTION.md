# How Businesses Actually Handle ZIP Code Maps

## The Reality: Nobody Loads 290MB Files!

Here's what successful businesses ACTUALLY do:

### 1. **Simplify the Boundaries** (90% file size reduction)
- Census boundaries have millimeter precision (unnecessary)
- Web maps only need ~100 meter precision
- Tools like Mapshaper reduce 290MB â†’ 30MB with NO visible difference

### 2. **Use Vector Tiles** (Load on demand)
Companies like Uber, DoorDash, Instacart use:
- Mapbox ($50-200/month)
- MapTiler (free tier available)
- Protomaps (self-hosted option)

### 3. **Progressive Loading**
- Split US into 5-10 regional files
- Load only regions where you have patients
- Cache loaded regions

### 4. **Use Existing CDN Services**
Many provide ready-to-use files:
- geojson.xyz (simplified boundaries)
- Natural Earth Data (public domain)
- OpenStreetMap extracts

## The Simple Truth

There's NO restriction on using ZIP code files. The issue is that raw Census files aren't optimized for web delivery. Every business that shows ZIP codes:
- Simplifies the boundaries (keeps visual quality)
- Loads progressively (not all at once)  
- Uses smart caching

## Immediate Solution for iBPM

1. Use our PA file for demo/testing
2. For production: Create 5 regional files (Northeast, Southeast, Midwest, Southwest, West)
3. Each file ~30-50MB (loads in 1-2 seconds)
4. Load based on patient distribution

This is EXACTLY how Tableau, PowerBI, and every other analytics platform handles geographic data!
