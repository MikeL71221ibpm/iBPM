# Alternative Clean Deployment Solution

## Current Situation
- Workspace is 12GB (1.8GB Git history + 700MB files + 547MB node_modules)
- Fork/Remix button location unclear
- Need clean deployment under 8GB limit

## Alternative Solution: Create New Replit Project

Since finding the Fork button is unclear, here's the alternative approach:

### Step 1: Create New Replit Project
1. Go to replit.com in a new browser tab
2. Click "Create Repl" or "+ New Repl"  
3. Choose "Node.js" template
4. Name it "behavioral-health-analytics-clean"

### Step 2: I'll Create Complete Deployment Package
I'll prepare a ZIP file containing:
- All your source code (client/, server/, shared/)
- Configuration files (package.json, .replit, etc.)
- Enhanced .gitignore (prevents future size issues)
- Environment variable template
- Setup instructions

### Step 3: Upload and Deploy
1. Upload the ZIP to your new project
2. Set environment variables (I'll provide the list)
3. Connect to your existing Neon database
4. Deploy successfully

## Advantages of This Approach
✅ Guaranteed under 8GB (no Git history bloat)
✅ All functionality preserved
✅ Same database with 73,925 symptoms
✅ Enhanced .gitignore prevents recurrence
✅ Clean deployment process
