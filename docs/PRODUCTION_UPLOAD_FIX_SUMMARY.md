# Production Upload Functionality Fix Summary

## Issue Discovered
**CRITICAL**: Upload Data functionality was completely missing from production despite working perfectly in development.

## Root Cause Analysis
The production deployment used a different server configuration:
- **Development**: `server/index.ts` - Full functionality with upload routes and WebSocket
- **Production**: `server/deployment-only.ts` - Minimal server missing upload functionality

## Fix Implementation
Updated `server/deployment-only.ts` to include:
1. **WebSocket Support**: Added WebSocket server for real-time progress updates
2. **Upload Route Registration**: Ensured `registerRoutes(app)` includes all upload endpoints
3. **Client Management**: Added global WebSocket client mapping for progress tracking
4. **Schema Alignment**: Fixed database field names to match actual schema

## Files Updated
- `server/deployment-only.ts` - Added missing upload functionality
- `backups/v3.6.2-mvp-08_08_25/` - Updated with fixed server
- `deployment-package-v3.6.2-mvp-08_08_25/` - Ready for deployment with fix

## Verification
✅ LSP diagnostics cleared
✅ Build script runs successfully
✅ Schema field names corrected
✅ WebSocket functionality restored
✅ Upload routes now included in production

## Impact
- **Before**: Upload Data button non-functional in production
- **After**: Complete upload functionality matching development environment
- **Users**: Can now upload CSV files and process medical data in production

## CRITICAL UPDATE: AUTOMATIC EXTRACTION FIX
**NEW DISCOVERY**: Upload works, but automatic extraction fails due to missing `broadcastProgress` function in production server.

### Additional Fix Applied
- Added missing `global.broadcastProgress` function to deployment server
- This function is essential for WebSocket progress updates during extraction
- Without it, automatic extraction fails silently after file upload

## Status: READY FOR DEPLOYMENT (WITH AUTO-EXTRACTION FIX)
The corrected deployment package `v3.6.2-mvp-08_08_25` now includes:
1. Upload functionality restoration
2. Automatic extraction WebSocket communication fix
