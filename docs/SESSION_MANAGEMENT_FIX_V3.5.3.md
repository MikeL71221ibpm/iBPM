# Session Management Fix - V3.5.3
## Critical Security Update for Customer Deployment

### Problem Summary
- **CRITICAL BUG**: Users seeing each other's data in production
- **Root Cause**: Mixed secure/non-secure cookie settings causing session crossover
- **Impact**: Healthcare data isolation failure - HIPAA compliance risk

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Dynamic Cookie Security (auth.ts)
```typescript
// Before: Hardcoded to false
secure: false

// After: Dynamic based on environment
const isSecureEnvironment = isProduction || process.env.REPL_SLUG;
secure: isSecureEnvironment
```

#### 2. Session Cleanup on Login
- Clears all existing sessions for a user before creating new one
- Prevents multiple active sessions per user
- SQL query removes old sessions from database

#### 3. Enhanced Logout Process
- Properly destroys session data
- Clears session cookie
- Logs session lifecycle for audit trail

#### 4. Session Validation Middleware
- Validates session integrity on each request
- Detects and corrects session mismatches
- Logs all session transitions for debugging

### Testing Protocol
1. Clear ALL browser cookies for production domain
2. Login as MikeL7122-2 
3. Verify seeing Mike's data (user_id 4)
4. Open incognito window
5. Login as BobL71221-4
6. Verify seeing Bob's data (user_id 14)
7. Return to first window and refresh
8. Verify still seeing Mike's data (no crossover)

### Deployment Steps
1. Deploy V3.5.3 with session management fixes
2. Monitor session logs for any anomalies
3. Test with multiple concurrent users
4. Verify data isolation is maintained
