# Extraction Progress Visibility Fix - V3.5.13
## Fixed: PostUploadLoading Stays Visible Throughout Entire Extraction Process

### Problem Statement
The PostUploadLoading component (with progress bar) was disappearing too early during extraction, leaving users with no visual feedback that processing was happening. This was a critical UX issue in production.

### Root Cause Analysis
Multiple conditions were causing the PostUploadLoading to hide prematurely:
1. WebSocket disconnect was clearing the state even during active extraction
2. The component was checking for `showPostUploadLoading` flag which got cleared too early
3. A 30-second failsafe timer was hiding the progress bar regardless of extraction status
4. Various useEffect hooks were clearing the state based on incomplete conditions

### Solution Implemented
Modified the visibility logic to keep PostUploadLoading visible during the ENTIRE extraction process:

1. **Extended Visibility Condition** (Line 1558):
   - Changed from: `showPostUploadLoading && (isExtracting || realTimeProgress > 0)`
   - Changed to: `isExtracting || realTimeProgress > 0 || (showPostUploadLoading && databaseStats.symptomCount === 0)`
   - This ensures it stays visible when extraction is active OR progress is showing OR just uploaded with no symptoms yet

2. **Upload Handler Enhancement** (Lines 1130-1148):
   - Added explicit `setShowPostUploadLoading(true)` after upload
   - Ensures the flag stays true throughout extraction

3. **WebSocket Disconnect Handler** (Lines 158-177):
   - Changed to maintain UI state during disconnects if extraction is ongoing
   - Only clears state when progress reaches 100%

4. **Progress Completion Logic** (Lines 190-202):
   - Only hides PostUploadLoading when progress reaches 100%
   - Adds 5-second delay after 100% to ensure data is saved

5. **Removed Premature Hiding** (Lines 361-365):
   - Removed 30-second failsafe timer that was hiding progress too early
   - Let extraction complete naturally

6. **Database Stats Check** (Lines 242-253):
   - Only clears state when extraction is truly complete (status='completed' AND progress=100)
   - Not just when symptoms exist

### Testing Confirmation
- PostUploadLoading now stays visible from upload start through entire extraction
- Progress bar updates in real-time via WebSocket
- Component only hides 5 seconds after reaching 100% completion
- Users have continuous visual feedback throughout the entire process

### Files Modified
- `client/src/pages/upload-page-controlling-file-05_24_25.tsx`

### Version
V3.5.13 - Production-ready fix for extraction progress visibility

### Impact
Users now have proper visual feedback during the entire extraction process, eliminating confusion about whether the system is working. This is especially important for large datasets that take 5-6 minutes to process.
