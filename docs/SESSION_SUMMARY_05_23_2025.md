# Session Summary - May 23, 2025

## Project Progress
Today we focused on creating a new Population Health Page (v2) that combines the fixed charts functionality with population health filters and the HRSN grid in one comprehensive view. This addressed the requirement to have all visualization components on a single, well-organized page.

### Completed Tasks:
1. Created a new `Population_Health_Page_v2_05_23_25.tsx` file that serves as the main population health analytics dashboard
2. Successfully implemented the layout with the following organization:
   - Header and navigation at the top
   - Population Health Summary showing patient counts and records
   - Main charts from fixed-charts-05_22_25.tsx in the middle section
   - "Apply Population Health Filters" section after the charts
   - "All HRSN Indicators" section with all 36 HRSN charts at the bottom

3. Fixed the implementation of charts to match exactly how they appear in `fixed-charts-05_22_25.tsx`
4. Added the FixedChart component to handle standardized chart rendering
5. Implemented chart improvements for better printing and visibility:
   - Added bold, black text to all chart values and axis labels
   - Added standardized export functionality using the ChartExportWidget
   - Relocated Population Health Summary statistics to be on the same line as the main title
   - Reduced all header font sizes by 50% for more compact display
   - Decreased spacing between elements to maximize screen space usage

### Issues Addressed:
1. Fixed an issue where the header and navigation were not displaying
2. Fixed an issue where the HRSN Grid Component was duplicated
3. Corrected the implementation of the main charts to match the fixed-charts version
4. Added proper component definitions to handle chart rendering and interactions
5. Successfully implemented bold, black text for better chart printing and visibility
6. Attempted to implement the standardized ChartExportWidget in expanded view but encountered visibility issues that will need further work

### Technical Details:
- The page uses a fixed component called `FixedChart` to create consistent chart visuals
- Each chart now includes count/percentage toggle, print, expand, and export functionality
- The HRSN Grid at the bottom displays all 36 HRSN indicators using the controlling file
- Population health filters allow users to filter by symptom segments, diagnoses, diagnostic categories, and symptom IDs

### Next Steps:
1. Test all chart functionality with real data to ensure proper rendering
2. Verify that the filter mechanisms work properly and update the charts accordingly
3. Ensure that all count/percentage toggles work uniformly across the entire page
4. Test print and export functionality from each chart
5. Consider adding additional interactive features to enhance user experience
6. Validate performance with the full dataset

### Implementation Notes:
- The page is accessible at `/population-health-v2` route
- The FixedChart component was integrated directly in the page component for simplicity
- The implementation maintains compatibility with existing data structures and APIs
