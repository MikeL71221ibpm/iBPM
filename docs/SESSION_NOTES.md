## Education Level Standards Documentation
**Date**: August 09, 2025  
**Priority**: High - Compliance Requirement

### USCDI Version 4 Standards
The platform must maintain alignment with Health IT.gov standards for Education Level data elements within Patient Demographics/Information category.

**Approved Education Level Categories**:

**Source**: United States Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) Version 4, referencing U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey values.

**Future Protocol**: Any changes to Education Level categories must be verified against current Health IT.gov USCDI standards before implementation.

## Geographic Visualization Implementation
**Completed**: Real ZIP code polygon boundaries for Population Health maps

### Technical Implementation
- **Component**: LeafletZipMap.tsx with React Leaflet
- **Data Strategy**: State-based ZIP code GeoJSON loading
- **Performance**: Loads only relevant states instead of full 1.1GB US dataset
- **Features**: Choropleth styling, hover effects, patient count popups
- **Integration**: Toggle system between new polygon maps and legacy maps

### Benefits
- Authentic ZIP code boundaries replace placeholder maps
- Optimized performance for healthcare provider users
- Real-time patient density visualization
- Professional geographic analytics for population health insights
