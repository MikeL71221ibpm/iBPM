# Session Summary - July 28, 2025 - HRSN Data Mapping Instructions

## Key Progress
- Implemented Education infographic following Age configuration pattern
- Added critical data integrity validation to prevent displaying synthetic data
- Documented comprehensive HRSN data mapping instructions

## Critical HRSN Data Mapping Rules

### General Rule
Most HRSN categories track "Yes" responses as indicating a problem

### Exceptions
"Has a Car" and "Has Transportation" track "No" responses as indicating a problem

### Specific Category Mappings

| HRSN Category | Track Response | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Financial Strain | Yes | Yes = Has financial problems |
| Housing Insecurity | Yes | Yes = Has housing problems |
| Food Insecurity | Yes | Yes = Has food access problems |
| Veteran Status | Yes | Yes = Is a veteran |
| Access to Transportation | Yes | Yes = Has transportation access issues |
| Has a Car | No | No = Does NOT have a car (problem) |
| Has Transportation | No | No = Does NOT have transportation (problem) |
| Utilities Insecurity | Yes | Yes = Has utilities problems |

## Data Integrity Implementation
- Education infographic now validates real data exists before display
- Shows "No data available" message when no actual education level data exists
- Prevents misleading display of ZIP codes with "Unknown" values

## Next Steps
- Implement remaining 8 HRSN infographic components
- Ensure proper Yes/No filtering based on documented mapping rules
- Maintain data integrity standards across all components
