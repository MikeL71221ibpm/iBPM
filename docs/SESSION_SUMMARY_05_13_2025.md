# Session Summary - May 13, 2025

## Overview
Today's session focused on enhancing the HRSN data visualization component in the Behavioral Health Analytics platform. The primary objectives were to implement standardized chart components, reduce the visual footprint of charts, add controls for user interaction, and improve the overall layout to make better use of available space.

## Completed Tasks

### Standardized HRSN Chart Implementation
- ✅ Created StandardizedHrsnChart component to manage all HRSN visualization types
- ✅ Implemented consistent display patterns:
  - Count data → Bar charts
  - Percentage data → Pie charts
  - Distribution data → Heatmaps
- ✅ Reduced all chart heights to 75px (25% of original 300px) for more compact display
- ✅ Standardized chart coloring scheme for visual consistency

### Chart Enlargement & Printing Functionality
- ✅ Added ability to enlarge individual charts for detailed viewing
  - Implemented Dialog component to display full-sized charts
  - Created maximize button in top-right corner of each chart
- ✅ Integrated PDF export functionality for individual charts
  - Used html2canvas to capture chart visuals
  - Used jsPDF to create downloadable chart PDFs
  - Added print button to enlarged chart view

### Spacing & Layout Optimization
- ✅ Reduced padding throughout components:
  - Limited text padding to max 14-16px as requested
  - Eliminated borders in compact mode
  - Reduced margins between chart elements
- ✅ Decreased grid gap between chart components (4px → 2px)
- ✅ Minimized card spacing and section margins (mb-4 → mb-2)
- ✅ Made text smaller in compact mode to optimize space usage
- ✅ Removed legend in compact mode for additional space savings

### HRSN Category Organization
- ✅ Implemented all HRSN categories in the correct order:
  1. Age_Range
  2. Gender
  3. Race
  4. Ethnicity
  5. Zip_code
  6. Financial_Status
  7. Housing_insecurity
  8. Food_insecurity
  9. Veteran_status
  10. Education_level
  11. Access_to_transportation
  12. Has_a_car (Added)
  13. Has Transportation (Added)
  14. Utilities

### Component-Level Improvements
- ✅ Added compactMode parameter to all chart components
- ✅ Implemented selection tracking for all chart types
- ✅ Optimized tooltips to be smaller and more space-efficient in compact mode
- ✅ Created responsive design that adapts to available space

## Notes & Issues

### Remaining Tasks
- Need to continue refining chart components for maximum space efficiency
- Chart padding could potentially be further reduced
- Additional testing needed for print functionality
- Consider adding a "print all selected charts" option

### Technical Notes
- Implemented in StandardizedHrsnChart and associated chart components
- All controlling files follow the naming convention "*-controlling-file-05_13_25.tsx"
- Modifications to chart components only made to the controlling files as required

## Next Steps
1. Verify all chart data is displaying correctly with the new standardized format
2. Further refine the UI for optimal space usage
3. Test print functionality thoroughly
4. Consider additional visualization requirements for clinical data
