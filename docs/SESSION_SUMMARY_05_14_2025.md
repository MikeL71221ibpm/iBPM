# Session Summary - May 14, 2025

## Improvements Implemented

### 1. Data Accuracy
- ✅ Corrected patient count from 100 to 24 patients to accurately reflect the database
- ✅ Updated record count from 4608 to 1062 records to match actual data volume
- ✅ Ensured filtering preserves the correct data source through all visualization components

### 2. UI Enhancements
- ✅ Made file information display more compact with a cleaner layout
- ✅ Fixed TopNav component "Sign In" link visibility using proper CSS techniques
  - Added minimum width and better spacing to prevent wrapping
  - Improved alignment with consistent padding and margin
  - Enhanced mobile responsiveness for the navigation bar
- ✅ Added whitespace-nowrap to all relevant text elements in TopNav
- ✅ Added a Visualization Data Source frame for printing with charts
  - Included file name and generation date information
  - Configured with print:block classes to only appear when printing
  - Styled with a subtle dashed border for visual separation

### 3. Filter Implementation
- ✅ Connected the HRSN problem filtering to ensure it works correctly
- ✅ Added proper filtering debugging messages to console
- ✅ Ensured filter configuration object is correctly passed to all chart components

### 4. Theme Integration
- ✅ Maintained backward compatibility between the new chart themes and legacy color schemes
- ✅ Fixed color scheme mapping to ensure consistent colors across all charts

### 5. Chart Consistency
- ✅ Verified all StandardizedHrsnChart components are using the filtered data correctly
- ✅ Confirmed correct data flow from API response through filtering to chart rendering

## Technical Issues Addressed
- Handled data integrity through proper fallback values (using || operators) rather than synthetic data
- Fixed console debugging to be more descriptive and helpful
- Added print-specific styling that only activates during print operations
- Used appropriate CSS flex layouts for better component alignment

## Known Issues To Address
- "Filter active:" section not displaying properly for HRSN Problems and Symptom IDs
  - Current issue: When selecting a filter from the dropdown, the filter states are being updated, but the "Filter active:" indicator section isn't showing all selected filters
  - Future fix: Update the filter display mechanism to correctly track and display all filter types including HRSN Problems and Symptom IDs
  - Priority: Medium - functionality works but UI feedback is incomplete

- Zip Code Density Map implementation needed
  - Current issue: The Zip Code Statistics section had placeholder text, but needs a proper zip code density map visualization
  - Future fix: Implement a geographic map visualization that shows patient distribution by zip code with color intensity
  - Priority: High - this is an important feature for geographic analysis of patient distribution

## Next Steps
- Implement the Zip Code Density Map visualization to show geographic distribution of patients
- Continue refining chart component rendering to ensure optimal visualization
- Fix the filter display issue to properly show all active filters (HRSN Problems and Symptom IDs)
- Explore improvements to filtering implementation when real patient data with symptoms becomes available
- Consider adding additional data export formats beyond the current PDF option
