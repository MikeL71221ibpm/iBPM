# Alternative Deployment Solution - No Fork Needed

## Current Situation
- Fork/Remix button not visible in chat interface (this is normal)
- App crash due to TSX server issues
- Need clean deployment without Git bloat

## Alternative Solution: Direct Clean Deployment

### Option 1: Create New Replit Project
1. Go to replit.com (separate browser tab)
2. Click "Create Repl" or "+ New Repl"
3. Choose "Node.js" template
4. Name it "behavioral-health-analytics-clean"

### Option 2: Try Current Workspace Cleanup
Let me attempt to clean the current workspace by:
1. Fixing the TSX server crash
2. Removing large files from Git history
3. Testing local deployment

## What I'll Do Now
1. Fix the immediate TSX server crash
2. Clean up the Git repository size issue
3. Test if deployment works after cleanup

## Backup Plan
If cleanup doesn't work, I'll prepare a complete deployment package that you can:
1. Download as ZIP
2. Upload to new Replit project
3. Deploy successfully

**Starting with TSX server fix now...**
