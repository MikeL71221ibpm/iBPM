# Remix Deployment Protocol - DEPLOYMENT ONLY

## STRICT GUARANTEE: NO FUNCTIONALITY CHANGES

### What Remix Will Do (Deployment Focus Only):
✅ Copy essential code files (client/, server/, shared/)
✅ Copy configuration files (package.json, .replit)
✅ Exclude large data files from Git history
✅ Create clean deployment environment
✅ Preserve ALL existing functionality exactly as-is

### What Remix Will NOT Do (Guaranteed):
❌ NO code modifications
❌ NO feature changes  
❌ NO UI alterations
❌ NO database schema changes
❌ NO authentication changes
❌ NO chart modifications
❌ NO functionality additions/removals

## Files to Copy (Code Only):
```
client/src/           # React components (unchanged)
server/               # Express backend (unchanged) 
shared/schema.ts      # Database types (unchanged)
package.json          # Dependencies (unchanged)
.replit              # Configuration (unchanged)
```

## Files to Exclude (Bloat Only):
```
.git/                # 1.7GB Git history
attached_assets/     # Large uploads
public/*.geojson     # Geographic data files
v3.*/               # Backup versions
```

## Deployment Steps:
1. Create Remix copy with EXACT same code
2. Install dependencies in clean environment
3. Connect to SAME Neon database (DATABASE_URL)
4. Deploy immediately - no modifications

## Success Criteria:
- Same login system works
- Same charts display
- Same 73,925 symptoms load
- Same WebSocket progress bars
- Same export functionality
- Identical user experience

## DEPLOYMENT ONLY MISSION:
Take working application → Clean environment → Deploy
NO changes to what the application does or how it works.
