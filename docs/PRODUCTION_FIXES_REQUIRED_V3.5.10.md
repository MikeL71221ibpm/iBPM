# Production Fixes Required for v3.5.10
**Date**: January 8, 2025
**Current Version**: v3.5.9
**Status**: Critical fixes needed before market release

## âœ… FIXED ISSUES (Already Completed)
1. **Export Bug** - Download now provides full patient data instead of "[object Object]"
   - Fixed CSV formatting with proper headers
   - Includes all patient fields in export
   - Added search criteria documentation in export

## ðŸ”´ CRITICAL ISSUES TO FIX (8 Items for Final Release)

### 1. Processing Data Notification Won't Dismiss
**Issue**: "Processing Data" notification persists for 4+ minutes after extraction completes
**Impact**: Users think system is still processing when it's actually done
**Solution Needed**: Auto-dismiss notification when processing reaches 100% or after timeout

### 2. AND/OR Boolean Toggle Not Visible
**Issue**: Users can't see which Boolean logic mode (AND vs OR) is active for searches
**Impact**: Users don't know if search will match ALL criteria or ANY criteria
**Solution Needed**: Add clear visual indicator showing current AND/OR state

### 3. Search Synopsis Missing Logic Display
**Issue**: Search results don't specify whether AND or OR logic was used
**Impact**: Users can't verify which Boolean logic was applied to their search
**Solution Needed**: Add "Using AND logic" or "Using OR logic" to search result synopsis

### 4. HRSN Search Returns 0 Records
**Issue**: HRSN problem searches always return 0 records
**Root Cause**: Likely configured for Symptoms only, not Problems
**Solution Needed**: Fix HRSN search to properly query Problems fields

### 5. Session Timeout Too Short
**Issue**: Users getting logged out too frequently during work
**Impact**: Disrupts workflow and frustrates users
**Solution Needed**: Extend session timeout to reasonable duration (e.g., 2-4 hours)

### 6. Progress Bar Overlaps Content
**Issue**: Floating progress bar covers important UI elements
**Impact**: Users can't interact with buttons/content behind progress bar
**Solution Needed**: Ensure progress bar doesn't block UI interaction

### 7. Database Widget Not Refreshing
**Issue**: Database statistics don't update after operations complete
**Impact**: Users see stale data counts
**Solution Needed**: Auto-refresh database widget after extraction/upload

### 8. Upload Button Too Prominent
**Issue**: Upload button size/prominence needs adjustment per user feedback
**Note**: This was approved for implementation on August 4, 2025
**Solution Needed**: Reduce upload button size as previously approved

## TESTING CHECKLIST
- [ ] Processing notification auto-dismisses
- [ ] AND/OR toggle clearly visible
- [ ] Search results show logic type used
- [ ] HRSN searches return correct records
- [ ] Session stays active for reasonable duration
- [ ] Progress bar doesn't block UI
- [ ] Database widget shows current counts
- [ ] Upload button appropriately sized

## DEPLOYMENT READINESS
Once these 8 issues are fixed:
1. Version will be v3.5.10
2. Ready for production deployment
3. Can proceed to market with confidence

## USER REQUIREMENT
**CRITICAL**: No changes to existing functionality without explicit user approval
- All fixes must preserve current working features
- Only fix the specific issues identified
- Do not refactor or "improve" unrelated code
