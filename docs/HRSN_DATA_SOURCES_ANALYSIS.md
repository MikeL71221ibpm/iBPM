# HRSN Data Sources Analysis - June 23, 2025

## Executive Summary

**CRITICAL FINDING**: The system has TWO distinct data sources for HRSN charts:

1. **Customer Data (üìä)**: ALL NULL - Customer uploaded data contains no HRSN information
2. **Algorithm Extracted Data (üîç)**: EXTENSIVE - 23,075 HRSN records extracted from clinical notes for 4,921 patients (97% coverage)

## Data Source Breakdown

### Customer Data (Patients Table)

## Technical Implementation for Charts

### Current Issue Resolution
‚úÖ **Pie Chart Fix**: Applied empty data validation to prevent 100% red circles when customer data is NULL
‚úÖ **Bar Chart Fix**: Fixed aggregation logic to show "No Data Available" when appropriate

### Data Source Integration Strategy

**For Each HRSN Chart Category:**

1. **Check Customer Data First** (patients table):
   - housing_insecurity, food_insecurity, financial_status fields
   - Currently ALL NULL for all 5,262 patients

2. **Check Algorithm Data Second** (extracted_symptoms table):
   - Filter by `symp_prob = "Problem"`
   - Map diagnosis categories to HRSN fields:
     - Financial: "Financial Strain" + "Finances/Financial Stress"
     - Housing: "Housing/Housing Instability/Insecurity"
     - Food: "Food Insecurity"
     - Transportation: "Transportation Insecurity"
     - Utilities: "Utility Insecurity"
     - Healthcare: "Access to health care"
     - Employment: "Employment"
     - Social: "Social connections / isolation"
     - Safety: "Safety/Child abuse"

3. **Display Logic**:
   - üìä Customer Data: When patients table has non-null values
   - üîç Algorithm Insights: When extracted_symptoms has symp_prob = "Problem"
   - üéØ Dual Sources: When both exist (shows intensity confirmation)
   - "No Data Available": When neither source has data

## Recommendations

### Immediate Action Items
1. **Update HRSN Chart Logic**: Implement dual-source data detection
2. **Visual Indicators**: Add data source badges (üìä üîç üéØ)
3. **Chart Titles**: Update to reflect data source transparency
4. **Data Validation**: Ensure proper empty state handling

### Future Enhancements
1. **Customer Education**: Inform customers that HRSN data can be provided in uploads
2. **Field Mapping**: Support various HRSN field name variations in customer data
3. **Data Integration**: When both sources exist, show comparative analysis
4. **Intensity Scoring**: Use dual-source confirmation as problem severity indicator

## Technical Notes

- **Database Fields**: 70+ HRSN-related columns in extracted_symptoms table
- **Coverage**: Algorithm extracted HRSN data for 97% of patients
- **Quality**: Rich, detailed HRSN categories with specific symptom segments
- **Authenticity**: All data from clinical note analysis, no synthetic data

This comprehensive HRSN extraction demonstrates the power of the V3.3.5 algorithm in identifying social determinants of health from unstructured clinical text.
