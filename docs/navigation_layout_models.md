# Navigation Layout Models

Based on your requirements to group visualization tools together and reorganize the navigation, here are several layout options:

## Model 1: Grouped by Function
```
[HRSN + BH Analytics] | [Pivot Tables] [Heatmaps] [Bubble Charts] | [Search] [Population Health] [Upload Data] | [Billing] [Admin] | [Logout] [Sign In]
```

## Model 2: Left-Side Visual Tools with Separators
```
[HRSN + BH Analytics] [Pivot Tables] [Heatmaps] [Bubble Charts] | [Search] [Population Health] [Upload Data] | [Billing] [Admin] | [Logout] [Sign In]
```

## Model 3: Visual Tools in Dropdown/Grouped Section
```
[HRSN + BH Analytics] [‚ñº Visualizations] | [Search] [Population Health] [Upload Data] | [Billing] [Admin] | [Logout] [Sign In]
```
Where "Visualizations" would expand to show: Pivot Tables, Heatmaps, Bubble Charts

## Model 4: Compact with Visual Grouping
```
[HRSN + BH Analytics] [üìä Charts] | [üîç Search] [üìà Pop Health] [üì§ Upload] | [üí≥ Billing] [‚öôÔ∏è Admin] | [Logout] [Sign In]
```

## Model 5: Two-Row Layout (if space is needed)
```
Row 1: [HRSN + BH Analytics]                                                    [Logout] [Sign In]
Row 2: [Pivot Tables] [Heatmaps] [Bubble Charts] | [Search] [Population Health] [Upload Data] | [Billing] [Admin]
```

Which of these models appeals to you most? Or would you like me to show you a live implementation of one of these layouts?
