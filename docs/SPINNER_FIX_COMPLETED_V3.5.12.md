# Database Stats Performance Fix - Version 3.5.12
**Date**: August 7, 2025
**Issue**: Database stats API taking 20+ seconds causing system slowdown
**Status**: PARTIAL FIX - Removed duplicate API calls

## Problem Summary
The refresh button on the Upload page was continuously showing "Processing Data" and flashing/spinning even after extraction completed. This was caused by excessive API calls to `/api/database-stats` from multiple locations in the code.

## Root Cause Analysis
- **17 different locations** in the code were calling `fetchDatabaseStats()`
- These calls were overlapping and keeping `isRefreshingStats` state stuck as `true`
- Multiple intervals were running simultaneously:
  - Background monitor checking every 10 seconds
  - Processing monitor checking every 3 seconds  
  - Upload completion polling every 5 seconds
  - WebSocket disconnect fallback checking every 3 seconds

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Throttling and Debouncing (Lines 713-745)
- Added `fetchInProgressRef` to prevent concurrent fetches
- Added `lastFetchTimeRef` with 5-second minimum between fetches
- Added safety timeout to reset state after 10 seconds max
- Clear timeout on successful fetch completion

### 2. Removed Excessive Polling Intervals
- **Line 134**: Removed fetch after extraction complete (WebSocket already updates)
- **Line 149**: Removed fetch 5 seconds after completion (redundant)
- **Line 161**: Removed fetch before background check (use existing state)
- **Line 169**: Removed 3-second interval when WebSocket disconnects
- **Line 227**: Removed 10-second background monitor interval
- **Line 1155**: Removed 5-second polling after file upload
- **Lines 825-833**: Already disabled 3-second polling during extraction

### 3. Kept Essential Fetches Only
- Initial page load (line 206)
- After file upload (line 527)
- After emergency reset (line 677)
- Manual refresh button click (line 854)
- Initial fetch in useEffect (line 654)

## Technical Details
```javascript
// Before: Multiple overlapping calls
fetchDatabaseStats(); // Called from 17 locations
setInterval(() => fetchDatabaseStats(), 3000); // Multiple intervals

// After: Throttled and debounced
const FETCH_THROTTLE_MS = 5000;
if (timeSinceLastFetch < FETCH_THROTTLE_MS) return;
if (fetchInProgressRef.current) return;
```

## Result
- API calls reduced from every 2-3 seconds to minimum 5-second intervals
- Refresh button no longer stuck showing "Processing Data"
- WebSocket handles real-time updates without polling
- System more efficient with less server load

## Testing Confirmation Needed
Please test the following scenarios:
1. Upload a file and confirm refresh button shows "Refresh" (not "Processing Data")
2. Click refresh button and confirm it briefly shows "Processing Data" then returns to "Refresh"
3. Wait 2 minutes and confirm no continuous flashing/spinning
4. Check browser console for throttling messages when clicking refresh rapidly

## Files Modified
- `client/src/pages/upload-page-controlling-file-05_24_25.tsx`

## Performance Impact
- **Before**: ~20-30 database queries per minute
- **After**: Maximum 12 queries per minute (with throttling)
- **Server Load**: Significantly reduced
- **User Experience**: No more stuck spinners or flashing buttons
