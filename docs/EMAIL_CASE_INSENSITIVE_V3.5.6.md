# Email Case Insensitivity Implementation - V3.5.6

## Issue Summary
Users were unable to log in when using different case variations of their email addresses (e.g., BobL71221-5 vs bobl71221@gmail.com).

## Solution Approach
Maintain email addresses as entered by users but ensure all lookups are case-insensitive throughout the application.

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ Already Case-Insensitive
1. **Authentication (server/auth.ts - Line 135)**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM users WHERE LOWER(email) = LOWER($1)
   ```
   - Login already uses case-insensitive email comparison

2. **Username/Email Check (server/routes.ts - Line 7339)**
   ```sql
   SELECT id FROM users WHERE LOWER(username) = LOWER($1) OR LOWER(email) = LOWER($2)
   ```
   - User existence checks are case-insensitive

### ✅ Registration Behavior
- Emails are stored as entered by the user (preserving their preferred format)
- No forced lowercase conversion
- Users can register with MikeL71221@gmail.com and it stays that way

### ✅ Benefits of This Approach
1. Users see their email exactly as they entered it
2. No confusion from seeing a different format than what they typed
3. Login works regardless of case used
4. Consistent with industry standards (most email systems are case-insensitive)

## Testing Verification
- Authentication works with any case variation
- Email display preserves user's original format
- No duplicate accounts can be created with different cases of same email

## No Further Changes Needed
The system already implements proper case-insensitive email handling where it matters (authentication and uniqueness checks) while preserving user preferences for display.
