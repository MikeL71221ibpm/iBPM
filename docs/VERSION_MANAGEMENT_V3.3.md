# Version Management Plan for IBPM v3.2 and v3.3

## Current Status
- We have v3.1 which has known issues
- We need to establish v3.2 as our current working version
- We will develop new features in v3.3

## Branch Structure
1. Maintain `main` branch as our production branch
2. Create `v3.2` branch to capture current stable code
3. Create `v3.3-development` branch for new features

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Establish v3.2 Baseline
1. Create a complete backup of the current codebase
2. Tag the current state as v3.2
3. Create a `v3.2-stable` directory with copies of all controlling files
4. Document all controlling files and their functions

### Phase 2: Feature Development for v3.3
1. Create working copies of files with "-v3.3" suffix for development
2. Implement and test features in isolation
3. Update the test tracking document with each feature's status
4. Document all changes and new controlling files

### Phase 3: Testing and Integration
1. Conduct component testing for each new feature
2. Perform integration testing to ensure components work together
3. Execute full workflow tests using our workflow document
4. Validate against requirements

### Phase 4: Deployment
1. Create a pre-release backup of v3.2
2. Rename v3.3 files to become the new controlling files
3. Update VERSION.md to indicate v3.3
4. Deploy the application
5. Perform post-deployment validation

## Test Tracking

For each component, we will track:
- Feature name
- Responsible controlling file
- Test status (Not Started, In Progress, Passed, Failed)
- Issues identified
- Resolution steps
- Tester

## Rollback Plan

If issues are encountered with v3.3:
1. Revert to the v3.2 backup
2. Restore original controlling files
3. Document issues encountered
4. Create targeted fixes for next iteration

## Documentation for v3.3

- Update user guides and documentation to reflect v3.3 features
- Create comparison document showing improvements from v3.2 to v3.3
- Maintain CHANGELOG.md with all significant changes
