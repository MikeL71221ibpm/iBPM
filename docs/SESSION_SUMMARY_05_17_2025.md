## Notes for CONTROLLING_FILES_MASTER_LIST.md

The following new controlling files should be added to the master list:

1. `client/src/components/search-flow-controlling-file-05_17_25.tsx`
2. `client/src/components/patient-heatmap-collection-controlling-file-05_17_25.tsx`
3. `client/src/components/hrsn-heatmap-controlling-file-05_17_25.tsx`
4. `client/src/components/population-health-charts-controlling-file-05_17_25.tsx`
5. `client/src/components/social-determinants-heatmap-controlling-file-05_17_25.tsx`

These files replace their older versions and should be the only ones referenced in the application going forward.

## Additional Standardized Components

We've also standardized the following visualization components:

6. `client/src/components/hrsn-pie-chart-controlling-file-05_17_25.tsx`
   - Created standardized version of the HRSN Pie Chart component

   - Created standardized version of the Categorical HRSN Chart component
   - Improved documentation and consistent type handling
   - Enhanced field mapping for better data source compatibility

8. `client/src/components/zip-code-map-controlling-file-05_17_25.tsx`
   - Created standardized version of the ZIP Code Map component
   - Integrated with the ChartTheme context for consistent styling
   - Maintained geographic visualization capabilities with improved error handling

9. `client/src/components/visualization-metadata-controlling-file-05_17_25.tsx`
   - Created standardized version of the VisualizationMetadata component
   - Enhanced documentation with descriptive header comments and type information
   - Updated all import references in 5 related components

## Next Steps

Additional components that should be standardized in upcoming sessions:
1. `HRSN Grid` component
2. Fix remaining LSP errors in the standardized components

## Completed Today

1. Standardized the `VisualizationMetadata` component:
   - Created `visualization-metadata-controlling-file-05_17_25.tsx` with improved documentation
   - Updated all import references in population health charts components
   - Added to the CONTROLLING_FILES_MASTER_LIST.md
   
2. Standardized the `StandardizedHrsnChart` component:
   - Created `standardized-hrsn-chart-controlling-file-05_17_25.tsx` with enhanced documentation
   - Updated component interfaces to work with standardized chart components
   - Improved prop documentation and type safety
   - Added better debugging and console messages

## LSP Error Resolution Progress

We've identified and started fixing LSP (Language Server Protocol) errors in various components. These errors primarily relate to:
1. Field name inconsistencies (camelCase vs snake_case)
2. Missing imports
3. Type compatibility issues with chart libraries

We'll continue addressing these issues in subsequent sessions.
